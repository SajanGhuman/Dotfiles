🛠️ Sajan's Dotfiles

Welcome to my personal Dotfiles repository! This is where I keep my configuration files for a clean, productive, and visually appealing development environment. 🔑 Key Features

    Arch Linux Setup: Yeah, I use Arch btw. But actually it's just setup how I like it.
    Omarchy and Hyprland: My go-to Wayland compositor. Smooth animations, efficient tiling, and crazy customizable.
    Nvim: My editor. Spent way too much time configuring it but worth it.
    Tmux: Beautiful and customizable session manager. Does the job.
    Ghostty Terminal: Fast, minimal, and themed exactly how I want it.
    Gruvbox Material Color Scheme: Consistent aesthetics across applications.
