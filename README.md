# 🛠️ Sajan’s Dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles — a curated setup for a clean, fast, and visually consistent development environment across my system.

## ✨ Features

- **Arch Linux**
  > Yes, I use Arch BTW — but really, it's just set up the way *I* like it.

- **Hyprland + Omarchy**
  Wayland compositor with smooth animations, efficient tiling, and endless customization.

- **Neovim**
  Highly tuned config for speed, productivity, and aesthetics.  
  Minimal plugins — maximum power.

- **Tmux**
  A polished and themed session manager for clean terminal workflow jumping.

- **Ghostty Terminal**
  Fast, minimal, GPU-accelerated, and themed exactly how I want it.

- **Gruvbox Material Everywhere**
  Because colors matter.  
  Consistent theme across terminal, Neovim, Tmux, and system UI.
